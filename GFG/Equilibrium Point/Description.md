# Question 

_Difficulty: Easy_

Given an array arr[] of non-negative numbers. The task is to find the first equilibrium point in the array.

The equilibrium point in an array is an index (0-based indexing) such that the sum of all elements before that index is the same as the sum of elements after it. Return -1 if no such point exists. 

**Examples :**
```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 3]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The sum of left of index 2 is 1 + 2 = 3 and sum on right of index 2 is 0 + 3 = 3.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no equilibrium index in the array.

Input: arr[] = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sum of left of index 3 is -7 + 1 + 5 = -1 and sum on right of index 3 is -4 + 3 + 0 = -1.
```

**Constraints:**
```
3 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
```

**Expected:**
Time: `O(n)`
Space: `O(1)`
