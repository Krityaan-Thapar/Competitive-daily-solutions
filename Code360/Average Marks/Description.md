# Question 

_Difficulty: Easy_

You are given the name of a student in the form of a character ‘firstLetterOfName’ and 3 integers ‘M1’, ‘M2’, ‘M3’ representing the marks of the student in 3 subjects. You have to print the ‘firstLetterOfName’ of the student and the average marks obtained by the student.

Note: You need to print the integer part of the average only and neglect the decimal part.
For Example :
If ‘firstLetterOfName’ = ‘K’, ‘M1’ = 10, ‘M2’ = 6 and ‘M3’ = 9, then the average marks would be around 7.67. Hence, the output should be as follows:
K 7

**Examples :**
```
Sample Input 1:
2
A
3 4 6
T
7 3 8

Sample Output 1:
A 4
T 6

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For sample case 1, average marks of the student are (3 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4.33 and his/her first character of the name is ‘A’. Therefore, the output is : A 4
For sample case 2, average marks of the student are (7 + 3 + 8)/3 = 6 and his/her first character of the name is ‘T’. Therefore, the output is : T 6

Sample Input 2:
2
Q
10 34 96
P
71 80 3

Sample Output 2:
Q 46
P 51

Explanation For Sample Input 2:
For sample case 1, average marks of the student are (10 + 34 + 96)/3 = 46.67 and his/her first character of the name is ‘Q’. Therefore, the output is : Q 46
For sample case 2, average marks of the student are (71 + 80 + 3)/3 = 51.33 and his/her first character of the name is ‘P’. Therefore, the output is : P 51
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= T <= 10
‘A’ <= ‘firstLetterOfName’ <= ‘Z’
0 <= M1 <= 100
0 <= M2 <= 100
0 <= M3 <= 100

Time Limit: 1 sec
```
