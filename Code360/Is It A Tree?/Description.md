# Question 

_Difficulty: Moderate_

Given a graph with 'V' vertices numbered from 0 to 'V' - 1 and 'E' edges. Determine if it is a tree or not?

**Examples :**
```
Sample Input 1:
3 2
0 1
1 2

Sample Output 1:
True

Explanation of Sample Input 1:
We clearly can see that it is a tree since it satisfies the property of a tree.

Sample Input 2:
3 3
0 1
1 2
0 2

Sample Output 2:
False

Explanation of Sample Input 2:
As we can see that it is not a tree since it doesn't satisfy the property of a tree.
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 < 'V' <= 10^5
0 <= 'E' <= min(10^5, V*(V-1)/2)
0 <= u, v <= V-1

Time Limit: 1 sec
```
