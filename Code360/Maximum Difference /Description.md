# Question 

_Difficulty: Easy_

You are given an array 'ARR' of the 'N' element. Your task is to find the maximum difference between any of the two elements from 'ARR'.
If the maximum difference is even print “EVEN” without quotes. If the maximum difference is odd print “ODD” without quotes.

For example:
Given 'ARR' = [1, 10, 5, 2, 8, 1 ] , answer is "ODD".
Here the maximum difference is between 10 and 1, 10 - 1 = 9

**Examples :**
```
Sample Input 1:
2
4
2 9 3 4
6
1 1 1 1 1 1 

Sample Output 1:
ODD
EVEN

Explanation of Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, the maximum difference is 7, between 9 and 2.
For the second test case, all elements are the same, the maximum difference is 0.

Sample Input 2:
2
2
567 11
1
28

Sample Output 2:
EVEN
EVEN 
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 5000 
1 <= ARR[i] <= 10 ^ 9
where ‘N’ is the length of the array 'ARR', and 'ARR[i]' is an element of the 'ARR' respectively.

Time limit: 1 sec.
```
