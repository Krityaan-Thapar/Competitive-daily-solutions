# Question 

_Difficulty: Medium_

You are given an integer ‘N’. You have to print the value of Factorial of ‘N’. The Factorial of a number ‘N’ is defined as the product of all numbers from 1 to ‘N’.
For Example:

Consider if ‘N’ = 4, the Factorial of 4 will be the product of all numbers from 1 to 4, which is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24. Hence, the answer is 24.
