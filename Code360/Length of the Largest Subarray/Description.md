# Question 

_Difficulty: Moderate_

You are given ‘N’ distinct integers in the form of an array ‘ARR’. You need to print the length of the longest subarray in which the numbers are present in a continuous sequence.

Note: All elements are distinct from the array.
For example:
Let ‘ARR’ be: [1, 2, 4]
Then the largest subarray with continuous sequence will be: [1, 2]
So the length will be 2.

**Examples :**
```
Sample Input 1 :
2
3
1 3 2
3
1 4 2

Sample Output 1 :
3
1

Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For test case 1: 
The whole array consists of continuous elements.
So the length is 3.

For test case 2: 
The largest subarray with continuous sequence will be [1] or [2] or [4].
So the length will be 1.

Sample Input 2 :
2
4 
14 12 11 20
3
10 12 11

Sample Output 2 :
2
3
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 5*10^3
1 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9

Time Limit: 1 sec
```
