# Question 

_Difficulty: Moderate_

You are given a positive integer N. Your task is to find the number of possible rectangles, excluding squares, in a N x N chessboard.
Example:

Let’s assume that we have a chessboard of dimension 4x4, i.e. N = 4. Then the rectangles can have the following possible dimensions: {1*2, 1*3, 1*4, 2*1, ……, 2*4, ………,4*4}. So, the total number of rectangles in the chessboard is 70.

**Examples :**
```
Sample Input 1:
2
4
1

Sample Output 1:
70
0

Explanation For Sample Input 1:
For the first test case refer to the example explained above.
For the second test case we have, a chessboard of dimension 1x1, i.e. N = 1. There are no possible rectangles. Hence, the answer is zero.

Sample Input 2:
2
2
5

Sample Output 2:
4
170
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= T <= 10 
1 <= N <= 5 * 10^4
```
