# Question 

_Difficulty: Easy_

Ninja is good at numbers. So today his friend gave him a task that required him to find out numbers made of 2 and 5 only less than a given limit.

Given an integer N, you need to print all numbers less than N which are having digits only 2 or 5 or both.
For example :

All numbers less than 30 with digits 2 and 5 are 2, 5, 22, 25.

**Examples :**
```
Sample Input 1 :
2  
10
100

Sample Output 1 :
2 5 
2 5 22 25 52 55

Explanation For Sample Output 1 :
For the first test case, only 2 and 5 are the required numbers. Hence we print them in ascending order.
For the second test case, we have 6 required numbers.

Sample Input 2 :
2
2
7

Sample Output 2 :
2
2 5
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^16
```
