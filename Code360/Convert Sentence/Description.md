_Difficulty: Easy_

You are given a sentence in the form of a string ‘S’. You have to convert ‘S’ into its equivalent mobile numeric keypad sequence, i.e. print the sequence in such a way that if it is typed on the given keypad, the output should be the string ‘S’. A keypad for the reference is shown below.
Note:

1. There will be only lower case letters.

333

Explanation for Sample Output 1:
For the first test case, for ‘c’ we have to press 2 three times, for ‘o’ we have to press 6 three times and so on. Hence we get the desired output.
