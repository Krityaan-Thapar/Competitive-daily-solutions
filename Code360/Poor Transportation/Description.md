# Question 

_Difficulty: Ninja_

There is a huge need for oxygen at Sata Hospital. The oxygen production industry Gorkha wishes to supply ‘N’ trucks of oxygen daily for ‘D’ days to Sata Hospital. There are ‘M’ paths numbered from 1 to ‘M’ between Gorkha and the hospital. Each truck requires a permit to travel on these paths.

The government has given ‘P’ permits to Gorkha Industry. Each permit consists of two integers ‘x’ and ‘y’. It says that trucks numbered ‘x’ are allowed to go through path number ‘y’.

Each path has a restriction on the number of trucks it can allow to travel on it. This restricted number is known as Capacity ‘C’.

Due to the poor construction, every day for the D days 1 particular path's capacity reduces by a number ‘R’.

For each day before the reduction takes place, you need to find the maximum number of trucks ‘T’ that can travel to SATA Hospital.

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= N, M <= 500
1 <= D, P <= 500
1 <= T <= N
1 <= X <= M
1 <= capacity[i], R <= 20  

Time Limit: 1 sec.
```
